# download method 1: set the User/repo of the github repository to download the latest release
# IE https://github.com/technobyl/CryptoDredge/releases is set as "technobyl/CryptoDredge"

# If the above does not apply and the miner is hosted at a wget friendly site you can set the download url
# DOWNLOAD_URL="http://URL.tgz"

# you can do a version check, or omit it for git relase auto updates. Great for use with DOWNLOAD_URL
#RELEASE_SHASUM="sha256sum of archive"

# If the miner has dependencies then add each .deb url here
#DEPENDS=(http://URL.deb http://URL.deb)

# You can also use a series of Hooks in order to run function specific commands for the miner
# These are generally not needed, be careful with using them.
